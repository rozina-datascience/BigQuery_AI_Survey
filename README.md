# BigQuery_AI_Survey
# 📌 “AI-Powered Survey Insights with BigQuery and Hugging Face”

---

## ❓ Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **AI-powered survey analysis pipeline** that transforms unstructured survey text into actionable insights. Organizations often collect large volumes of feedback, but manual analysis is time-consuming, prone to bias, and inefficient.  

Our solution leverages **BigQuery AI** and **Hugging Face Transformers** to automatically:  
- Extract survey questions  
- Aggregate survey responses  
- Generate actionable insights  
- Demonstrate feasibility of AI summarization under billing restrictions

## 🔧 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Extract Survey Questions
- **Objective:** Identify questions to map responses accurately.  
- **Approach:** Extract lines starting with "Q1", "Q2", etc., or ending with a question mark.  
- **Outcome:** Structured question dataset for aggregation and summarization.

### 2️⃣ Extract or Simulate Responses
- **Objective:** Collect answers for analysis or create dummy responses for demonstration.  
- **Approach:** Map responses to questions; generate representative dummy data if real responses are unavailable.  
- **Outcome:** Consistent dataset for AI summarization.

### 3️⃣ Aggregate Survey Results
- **Objective:** Identify trends and patterns in responses.  
- **Approach:** Calculate percentages or averages for categorical and numeric answers.  
- **Outcome:** High-level metrics and trends for stakeholders.

### 4️⃣ Generate Insights with Hugging Face Summarizer
- **Objective:** Automate summarization of aggregated responses.  
- **Approach:** Use Hugging Face models to create concise, actionable insights for each question.  
- **Outcome:** Readable insights ready for decision-making.

### 5️⃣ BigQuery AI Code Snippets
- **Objective:** Demonstrate platform-specific AI capabilities.  
- **Key Functions:** `ML.GENERATE_TEXT`, `AI.GENERATE_TABLE`, `GeminiTextGenerator`.  
- **Outcome:** Shows workflow scalability when billing is enabled.

### 6️⃣ Semantic Analysis Concept
- **Objective:** Enable intelligent triage of support tickets or feedback.  
- **Approach:** Use vector embeddings and vector search for semantic similarity.  
- **Outcome:** Rapid identification of recurring issues and suggested solutions.
