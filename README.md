📌****AI-Powered Survey Insights with BigQuery and Hugging Face****


In today’s business world, **~80% of organizational data is unstructured**, including survey responses, support tickets, product feedback, and open-ended forms. Traditional methods—manual review, keyword searches, or basic statistics—often **fail to capture the semantic meaning** behind the text.

As a result, **business decisions are delayed**, hidden patterns go unnoticed, and valuable insights remain locked in raw text.

Modern AI techniques, including **text embeddings and summarization**, overcome these challenges by:

- 🧠 Understanding the meaning behind different phrasing  
- 🔎 Identifying recurring themes across thousands of entries  
- 📌 Generating actionable recommendations without manual effort  

**🎯 Goal:** Build a **solo, free-tier pipeline** using Hugging Face, FAISS, and Python (with optional BigQuery AI integration) to extract insights from unstructured text efficiently.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Organizations collect massive amounts of textual data, but **hidden insights remain difficult to extract**:  

- 📩 Support teams struggle to find semantically similar tickets due to minor differences in wording.  
- 📝 Survey responses contain overlapping concerns and subtle sentiment patterns.  
- 📦 Product feedback and descriptions often contain valuable but overlooked trends.  

**✅ Solution:** Implement the **Semantic Detective pipeline** using embeddings, FAISS, and summarization models to:  

- Map questions to responses  
- Identify semantic similarity  
- Aggregate results for actionable insights  

---

##📝 Notes:

1️⃣ Free-Tier Adaptation

BigQuery AI functions like ML.GENERATE_TEXT or AI.GENERATE_TEXT require billing. Since this notebook uses the free-tier, text summarization is done locally in Python using the HuggingFace transformers pipeline.

2️⃣ BigQuery Integration Survey questions and responses are uploaded to BigQuery tables: hackathon_dataset.survey_questions → stores survey questions hackathon_dataset.survey_responses → stores both questions and answers This demonstrates integration with BigQuery, satisfying the hackathon requirement.

3️⃣ Summarization HuggingFace summarizes all team responses into one concise paragraph. The summary is stored in the variable solo_insights_report and printed for review.

## 📝 Notes  

- This project was implemented entirely on **free-tier resources** (Google Colab + Hugging Face).  
- No **BigQuery billing** was required — only local execution.  
- The solution follows the **Semantic Detective approach**, combining:  
  - 📌 **Hugging Face embeddings** for semantic understanding  
  - 📌 **FAISS vector search** for similarity detection  
  - 📌 **Summarization models** for generating insights  
  - Includes **survey analysis**, showing how recurring themes and feedback can be summarized into actionable insights.  
  - The pipeline is **modular, scalable, and reproducible**, ensuring others can run it without paid cloud services.
