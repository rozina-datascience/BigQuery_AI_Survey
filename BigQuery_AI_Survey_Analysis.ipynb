        "In today’s business world, **~80% of organizational data is unstructured**, including survey responses, support tickets, product feedback, and open-ended forms. Traditional methods—manual review, keyword searches, or basic statistics—often **fail to capture the semantic meaning** behind the text.  \n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, **business decisions are delayed**, hidden patterns go unnoticed, and valuable insights remain locked in raw text.  \n",
